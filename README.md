# deck-of-cards

November 12, 2019

Python Version: 3.7.4

To Run: Simply run "python ." or "python \_\_main\_\_.py" from the command line.

After finishing splitting, I am leaving this project as is for a while to focus on others. That being said, please feel free to leave issues on things you would like to see added and I will return to this project to clean it up and add features when I have time.

TODO:

* Expand unit tests

* Add functionality for:
  * Double down
  * Betting/payout rates/insurance
  * Refill deck on last drawn card rather than after every hand

* Move blackjack.py to new folder, so games are separate from
    the base cards

* Create hand.py base class, which BJHand extends

* Create player base class, which BJPlayer extends
